## [1.0.4] - 2025-10-15

### Added

- The language switcher block (`> üåê Available in other languages:...`) is now automatically added to the root `README.md` if it is missing, making the initial setup easier.

### Fixed

- Fixed a critical bug where Markdown table structures would break in some translations (e.g., Chinese) due to corrupted separator lines.
- Resolved an issue where placeholders for protected content (like code blocks) were being incorrectly translated in certain languages (e.g., Polish), causing parts of the README to not render correctly.
- Corrected multiple Markdown list formatting errors where spaces after list item markers (`-`) were removed or unwanted indentation was added, ensuring lists render correctly across all languages.
- Improved the overall robustness of the translation process by adding better protection for various Markdown syntax elements.
